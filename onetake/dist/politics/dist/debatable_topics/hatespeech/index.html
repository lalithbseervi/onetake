    <p>Instances of High Ranking politicians using divising and hate speech has increased by 500%, this number is not from an Anti-National organisation, but 
        it is a number that NDTV obtained in a data collection exercise.
    </p>
    <p> Social media has seemed to make it easy for these very same politicians to incite more violence every day as they have followers ranging from few 
        thousand to millions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: The Hate Speech we are talking about is defined as follows: Any statement that are clearly communal, castiest or incites violence. Some of these
        instances cover violations of laws that could invoke action such as Section 295A (outrageous feelings towards religion), Section 153 (promoting enmity
        between groups) or Section 505 (making statements conducing to public mischief). However, unfortunately we don't see these laws being enforced properly
        by the Executive and these politicians who promote hate are given a clean chit most of the times. It is we who have to decide whether we should allow them
        to continue this outrageous and unlawful behaviour.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Comments that may not be directly communal but are clearly loaded against a particular community or religion have also been included while sexist remarks
        have been excluded to maintain and save ourselves from going irrational after reading so many ridiculous statements.
    </p>
    <p> This exercise was done during 2009-2014 and 2014-2018, and NDTV have specifically concentrated on elected representatives, members of the parliament, 
        legislative assemblies & Chief Ministers.
    </p>
    <p> The data has been collected from network of reporters and have also checked about 1000 tweets till April 2018.</p>
    <p> This is uncomparable to a perfect record but it still gives an rough idea. Based on their data, 124 instances of VIP hate speech by 45 politicians,
        compared to 21 instances under UPA 2, an increase of 490% from May 2014.</p>
    <p>
        Out of the 45 politicians who were responsible for hate speeches since Modi Government came into power, only five cases were found where the politicians 
        were cautioned or have been asked to publically apologise. 
    </p>
    <p> One case in particular that I am very unhappy about is T Raja Singh, a BJP MLA from Telengana. He has made hate speeches repeatedly. Some of his statements
        go as follows: "Every Hindu should carry weapons like lathis and attack other communities' members if they said anything wrong." ~ January 2018.
        Another instance goes like this: "Muslims have no business being in India, and should go to Pakistan or Bangladesh." ~ February 2018.

        A popular theme in hate speeches is to delegitimise the Muslim beliefs or inciting fears of a Muslim takeover by playing fears on an increasing Muslim
        population.
    </p>
    <p> Surendra Singh, BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh said in January 2018, "Muslims who assimilate into our culture will stay in India. Those who will not are free 
        to take asylum in any other country."</p>
    <p> This database shows hate speeches till April 17, 2018.</p>
