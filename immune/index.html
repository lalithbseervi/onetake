    <h1> Introduction: A Vague Idea </h1>
    <p> The Immune System is defined as a network of biological processes that protect an organism from diseases. It responds to a wide variety of threats such as
        viruses and parasites. Many species tend to have 2 major subsystems of the immune system. First one being the innate immune system and second being the 
        adaptive immune system. This trend is mostly found in vertebrates. </p>
    <h2> Innate Immune System: The Old Method </h2>
    <p> The Innate Immune System is an older evolutionary method, and is the dominant immune system response among plants, fungi, insects and primitive multicellular
        organisms. Some of the major functions include: </p>
        <p> Recruitment of immune cells to infection sites by producing chemical mediators such as cytokines. </p>
        <p> Activates the Complement Cascade to identify bacteria and promote clearance of antibody complexes or dead cells. </p>
        <p> Identification of foreign substances present in organs, tissues, blood and lymph, done by specialized white blood cells. </p>
        <p> Activates the adaptive immune system. </p>
        <p> Acts as a physical barrier by forming clotts to prevent further invasion of foreign microbes. </p>
    <h2> Adaptive Immune System </h2>
    <p> This immune sub-system mainly consists of 2 specialized cells that eliminate pathogens or prevent them from growing. The difference between Innate Immune System
        and Adaptive Immune System being that while the Innate Immune System is pre-programmed or already prepared for certain microbial threats, the Adaptive Immune 
    System is very specific. It uses immunological memory after having encountered a specific pathogen. In simpler terms, the Adaptive Immune System remembers
    the structure of the pathogens which it has previously encountered. Antibodies are a very important part of the Adaptive Immune System. This sub-system can
    provide long-lasting protection, sometimes for as long as a person's lifetime. For eg. A person who gets infected from measels and recovers, that person is 
    protected against measels for their entire life; in other cases, it may not provide lifetime protection. For eg. Chickenpox. The process of Adaptive Immune System
    is the basis of vaccination. The cells carrying out the Adaptive Immune Response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. B cells and T cells are two
    such lymphocytes carry out some important tasks: Antibody response and cell mediated response. </p>
    <h2> Sub-Topic: Antibody Response </h2>
    <p> In Antibody Response, the B cells activate and secrete/release antibodies, and antibodies as we know it are basically proteins known as immunoglobulins.
        These antibodies move throughout the bloodstream and bind/anchor to foreign antigen (Antigens are basically substances that trigger the adaptive immune system).
        This response causes the antigen to deactivate. Sometimes this is the reason behind hayfever, asthma or any allergy because the antibodies can deactivate harmless
        antigens. 
    </p>
    <p> In Adaptive Immune System, receptors specific to certain pathogens are acquired/gained during the lifetime of an organism, whereas, in Innate Immune System 
        pathogen-specific receptors are already encoded in the genome. This allows the Adaptive Immune System to be prepared for future challenges.
    </p>
    <p> NOTE: The following text may not be completely scientifically correct. </p>
    <p> The reason why Covid-19 vaccine works, after having read all this, is because the vaccine basically contains Covid-19 which cannot harm another person. So,
        while the Covid-19 moves through the body without harming anything, the Adaptive Immune System recognises that there is a foreign antigen, and hence, it 
        starts to prepare antibodies accordingly. Once the antibodies are ready, the Adaptive Immune System attacks the virus and the B-cells remember the virus. So,
        the next time you actually get infected by Covid-19, this same chain of events will execute, providing protection to you. And please do not resist taking the 
        vaccine just because I said that it contains Covid-19. The vaccines are not harmful in any manner. They are completely harmless and were made in the first place
        for your protection.</p>
