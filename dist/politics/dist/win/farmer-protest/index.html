        Farmer's Protest In India has been a very huge topic in India -- atleast for those who aren't from Godi Media. This protest was started in August - September 
        2020 against 3 farm bills that were passed without any consulation. It was just forcefully fed into Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
    </p>
    <p>24th September 2020, the farmers started a campaign called "Rail Roko". The farmers would protest on the train tracks making the trains refrain to go to Punjab
        or out of Punjab. After extending the campaign till 23rd October, some farmer unions called off the campaign as the supplies of fertilizers and other goods
        were running short in Punjab. The media was calling out protesters with the name "Andolanjeevi", referring to people who support their living by participating
        in protests. This kind of attitude towards the protesters was infuriating in my opinion.

        After not getting support from the farmer's respective state Governments, farmers decided to protest all the way to Delhi to pressurise the Central Government.
        25th November 2020, protesters from Dilli Chalo (let's go to Delhi) campaign faced police and other forces at the border. The police made use of everything,
        ranging from tear gas to water cannons, breaking road connections, layering barricades. They even had sand barriers to stop protesters

        Following these events, millions of people accross India opposed the farm law and changes to labour law via a 24-hour strike. Fast forward to 26th January 2021,
        thousands protested in Delhi, where tractor rallies and a storming of the Red Fort took place. Later, due to the Covid situation in the Country, the protests 
        calmed down for a while.
    </p>
    <p> After the Covid situation had gotten under control, the farmers started protesting once again, however, 90% of the cable media didn't cover the farmers protest
        in 2021. The farmers had launched their own newspaper sometime during the protests.
    </p>
    <p> 19th November 2021, PM Modi addressed the nation and announced that they would be repealing 3 farm bills. The farmers, in general, were happy. However, 
        they wouldn't back off until MSP (Minimum Support Price) is assured.
