    <p>The BJP Party pledged in the 2014 manifesto that they would do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Establish a corruption free system.</li>
        <li> Simplification of tax regime.</li>
        <li> To address the Credibility Crisis, defined as "In recent years, the Union Government has lost every semblance of credibility. Its intentions,
            integrity and initiatives, all are questionable." "The BJP will work for restoring the trust and credibility of the
            Government. We will also ensure that the chain of responsibility and accountability is built in the
            system."</li>
        <li> Encouragin "openness in the Government. </li>
        <li> The philosophy and religion of a Government should be India First. </li> 
        <li> The only epic of a Government should be India's Constitution. </li>
        <li> The only power of a Government should be the power of the people. </li>
        <li> The only prayer of a Government should be the welfare of its people. </li>
        <li> Open Government and Accountable Administration. </li>
        <li> Food Security </li>   
    </ul>
    <p>I do not see a corruption free system, simple payment system for taxes, credibility of the union Government, openness in the Government, welfare of the
        poeple, or food Security. </p>
    <p>If you leave Whatsapp University for a minute, you will see that India still has corruption, infact, the BJP has legalised corruption according to some
        poeple because of the decision on electoral bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't seen people happily saying that it's easier to pay taxes. I don't see people saying that BJP has credibility. Infact, I think other parties
        like AAP(Aam Aadmi Party) has more credibility, albiet, we are yet to see what happens as the party expands into other states. It still clearly shows
        that BJP hasn't delivered it's promises.
    </p>   
    <p>
        I haven't seen the Constitution being followed by BJP members, let alone the citizens of India. There have been more hate speeches than ever, there has
        been more mob lynchings and alot of other crimes have seen a rise. So, I do not understand what the BJP meant by "The only epic of a Government should 
        be the Constitution" because if that's the case, then they should abide by the law.
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't seen welfare be mentioned in any speeches so far, and even if it has been mentioned, there has been no evidence of better welfare in this
        country. It seems as though that whatever BJP promised hasn't gone to plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me tell you a little about "Food Security" because according to rankings, India has been placed on 101st position out of 116. </p>
