        <summary>Description Of Sedition Law</summary>
        <span>The Sedition law says "Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible 
            representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or 
            attempts to excite disaffection towards, the government established by law in India, shall be punished 
            with imprisonment which may extend to three years, to which a fine may be added; or, with fine."</span>

    <p> I truly believe this law is being misused by the government and it should, with no doubt be repealed
        in the light of protection of innocent citizens. The law since added has been misused against people
        ranging from students, intellectuals, teachers, journalists, environmental activists, human rights 
        activists and many more. There is a difference between rightfully criticizing the government, making a 
        false propaganda against the government and destabilizing the government.</p>    

    <p> I believe the Section 124-A is unsuited for a democratic nation like India. This law has been misused
        multiple times to suppress the opinion of journalists, teachers, students, intellectuals and many more.
        It is not a new occurence in which the Section 124A has been used in an unfair manner. We knew the 
        downsides of this Law way back in the late 19th Century.</p>

    <p> As far as I know, the citizens of India have no intention of disturbing public peace or the
        functioning of the Government.</p>

    <p> In recent years, we have seen a rise in the cases of sedition and many of those cases lacked evidence.
        Hence, I ask the IPC, Parliament and the Supreme Court to repeal this law in the light of protection of
        democracy and citizens of this Nation.</p>
    
    <p> Very recent developments have shown the misuse of sedition law. Here's a few examples.</p>
    <p>These articles are just to name a few cases, but in reality there are many more such cases where people are eager to be served justice.</p>
    <p>History of Sedition: </p>
    <p>1951, the Punjab High Court ruled Section 124A to be unconstitutional. And a similar ruling was passed in 1959 by the Allahabad High Court.</p>
    <p>There have been several sedition cases, Vishva Hindu Parishad General Secretary Praveen Togadia (2003), Simranjit Singh Mann (2005), Binayak Sen (2007),
         Arundhati Roy (2010), Aseem Trivedi (2012), Rinshad Reera (2012), Climate Activist Disha Ravi (2020) just to name a few. </p>
    <p>In my opinion, the purpose of this law is not to convict the people who have been charged, but to harass, silence and threaten critics of the government by
        the means of a long process of court hearings.
    </p>     
    <p> Something to think about here is that why does the government need this colonial law of sedition after 75 years of Independence? I call the law colonial
        as it was introduced during British rule who intentionally used this law to supress the voice of freedom fighters.

    <p> What can we do to stop this?</p>
    <p> We can try to explain why sedition law is unconstitutional, using ethical means to spread the message of stopping the use of sedition law and repealing it.
        All that, without any violent protests, or hate towards the government, as that goes against the ethical means that I refer to here.
